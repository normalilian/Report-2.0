# Initial Data Analysis (IDA)
```{r}

survey=read.csv("SurveyResponses.csv")

str(survey)
```

```{r}
#Load 'tidyverse' package
library(tidyverse)

#DATA CLEANING

# Exclude intentionally silly responses

# Change the 'Like 30-40hrs' response to N/A

# Replace 'None' in Naps with 0

### Source
* [where the data came from]

### Structure
[size & type of variables, incl. reclassification]
* There are 152 individual responses exploring 11 variables.

### Limitations
* [careful: â€˜Statistical Thinkingâ€™]

### Assumptions
* [a priori ideas]

### Data Cleaning
[changes from original format]




# Research Question/s
## Does Caffeine strongly influence Hours of Sleep differently for Fe/males? 
```{r}
# SCATTERPLOT of CAFFEINE & SLEEP: 
P=ggplot(surveyC, aes(Shots/7,Sleep,fill=Sex)) +geom_point(size=3, pch=21) +labs(x="Caffeine (shots)", y="Sleep (hours)", title="Relationship between Caffeine and Hours of Sleep") +scale_fill_manual(values=c("magenta","cornflowerblue"))
P
```

### Correlation Coefficients (2x)

```{r}
#Create subsets for Fe/male
Fem_surveyC=subset(surveyC, surveyC$Sex =="Female")
Male_surveyC=subset(surveyC, surveyC$Sex=="Male")
```

* Female
```{r}
Fem_cor=cor(Fem_surveyC$Sleep,Fem_surveyC$Shots)
Fem_cor
```
* Male
```{r}
Male_cor=cor(Male_surveyC$Sleep,Male_surveyC$Shots)
Male_cor
```

### Regression Lines (2x)
* Female
```{r}
Lf=lm(Fem_surveyC$Sleep~Fem_surveyC$Shots)
Lf$coeff
lm(Sleep~Shots, Fem_surveyC)
```
* Male
```{r}
Lm=lm(Male_surveyC$Sleep~Male_surveyC$Shots)
Lm$coeff
lm(Sleep~Shots, Male_surveyC)
```
### Residual Plots (2x)
```{r}
par(mfrow=c(1,2))
plot(Fem_surveyC$Shots, Lf$residuals, xlab="Caffeine (shots)", ylab="Residuals") + abline (h=0,col="magenta")
plot(Male_surveyC$Shots, Lm$residuals, xlab="Caffeine (shots)", ylab="Residuals") + abline (h=0,col="cornflowerblue")
```


### Regression Lines on Scatterplot
```{r}
R=ggplot(surveyC, aes(Shots/7,Sleep,fill=Sex)) +geom_point(size=3, pch=21) +labs(x="Caffeine (shots)", y="Sleep (hours)", title="Relationship between Caffeine and Hours of Sleep") +scale_fill_manual(values=c("magenta","cornflowerblue")) +geom_smooth(method="lm", se=TRUE, size=1)
R
```

**Summary and Analysis**
* [Correlation between weak/strong. Linear model shows. Weak correlation for feamles (r=0.18) and males (r=0.19) can likely be explained by...]


### Latest Screen Time on Hours of Sleep?
```{r}
S=ggplot(surveyC, aes(WakeO, Sleep,fill=Screen) +geom_point(size=3, pch=21,aes(col=Screen)) +labs(x="Wakeup Time", y="Sleep (hours)", title="Latest Screen Time on Hours of Sleep") +geom_smooth(method="lm", se=TRUE)

S

```


* Wake (time)/Work (hours) on Hours of Sleep?
```{r}
WakeO=factor(survey$Wake, levels=c("2:00","4:30", "4:45","5:00","5:30","6:00","6:30","6:45","7:00","7:10","7:15","7:20","7:35","8:00","8:30","9:00","9:30","10:00","10:30","11:00","11:30","12:00"))

W=ggplot(surveyC, aes(WakeO, Sleep,fill=Screen)) +geom_col(size=3, pch=1,aes(col=Screen)) +labs(x="Wake up Time", y="Sleep (hours)", title="Relationship between Wake Up Time on Hours of Sleep") +theme(axis.text.x=element_text(angle=90, vjust=0.5, hjust=1))

# Wake-up time or Work (hours) --> Was thinking maybe a Histogram??
